Transaction Log
===============

All the transactions that ever happened through the OWTF proxy can be searched through transaction log.
You can search in multiple fields. A sample look of the transaction log is in the image below.

There are two ways in which individual transactions can be viewed

    * Each transaction in new tab
    * Transaction in a modal window

Clicking on the info button will open a model window which allows you to navigate back & forth between
the filtered transactions. The search words are highlighted as well.
