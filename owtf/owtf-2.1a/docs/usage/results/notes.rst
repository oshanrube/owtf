Saving your analysis
====================

Once you start analyzing the plugin results, there is a need for ranking those findings
along with saving some necessary information if needed. OWTF has both these features

Manual Ranking
--------------

In order to rank a plugin output, you can use the ranking buttons based on severity

Notes
-----

Ranking is not the only thing, you can also write and save notes as well. Click on the **NOTES**
button to open an editor and once you are done, click on the same button to save and close the editor
