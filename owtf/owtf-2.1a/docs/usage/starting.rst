Starting OWTF
=============

.. warning::
    Before starting OWTF, make sure you have the postgres database server running.
    This can be easily ensured by using scripts/db_run.sh

OWTF is controlled and used from a web interface, so you have to launch OWTF from
command line and then move on to your favourite browser. OWTF can be launched by

.. code-block:: bash

    ./owtf.py

The interface url is printed onto the console, so that you can directly click on it
